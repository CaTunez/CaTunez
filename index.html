        <h2>Get a download manager</h2>

        Direct Download Websites
            These websites do not require a VPN because you are downloading directly from a server and not exposing you IP through a torrent server. If you can't find a game you want i'd recommend to check torrents with caution.
        
        -Websites
        
        *https://steamrip.com/
        -Has almost every game you would want
        *https://www.gog-games.to/
        -Has most Indie games and games on GOG.com
        *https://www.ovagames.com/
        -Another good option like Steamrip
        
        How to download off of Steamrip
            There are typically 2-4 download options for a steamrip game, The best one will always be MegaDB. If MegaDB isn't available or has slow download speeds I recommend using Buzzheavier, Be aware this website has ads that link to virus's. If neither of these options are available i'd use GoFile. In the circumstance that the only option is 1FICHIER is available, i'd recommend to just go to another website I have provided. If MegaDB is a Torrent, read until you reach the torrent section of this.
        
        Repacks/Torrent Websites
            These websites require VPN's and can get you in trouble with the law/Your internet service to contact you and ban you from their services. These websites typically have more games than Direct Download websites because they are never taken down and people are always seeding the games
        
        -Torrent Apps

        FAQ
        
        *Will my internet provider report you to the police?
        -Typically no, Usually they will warn you before they cancel your services with them and ban you from ever buying from them again.
        *Will my Internet Provider Know if I pirate off of Direct Download websites?
        -No they can't because you are downloading off of a private server that is giving you an encrypted file, You will only get caught if you are downloading off of a Repack/Torrent Website if not using a VPN
        *I can't find my game file, where do I find it?
        -Look in the main folder and locate a file typically named "GAME LAUNCHER LOCATION" and it will give you the exact folder path you need to go into to find the game</p>
